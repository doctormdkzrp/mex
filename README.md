## Requirements

You must have both `7za` / `7z` and `unrar` installed on your system and included in your system `PATH`.

## Features

*   Process most compressed formats, including nested archives 🌮
*   Detect best quality volumes in the presence of duplicates 🌶️
*   Rename volumes and pages using templates for consistency 🫔
*   Exclude any irrelevant garbage files present in your archives 🥑
*   Output loose images, CBZ archives, or a combination of both 🌯

## Usage

To process an archive just pass it on the command line to Mex:

```

Additional options can be viewed by running with the `-help` flag:
